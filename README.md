<p><h3 style="color: #F7943C;">What is the
purpose of the project?</h3>
<p>At the beginning, this project did not have any architecture, because I did not know what I wanted to do.
Subsequently, it became a kind of social network where users can create articles, as they would do it on a personal blog,
rate and comment on them.</p>
<p>But the main idea of the project is to demonstrate my skills in working with models, creating forms, creating views,
both based on classes and functions. Overriding framework functions such as get_queryset, object_list creation in a
class, or form validation. Also, the use of signals, context processors and custom tags.</p>
